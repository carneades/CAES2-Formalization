This a complete formalization of Version 2 of Carneades Argument Evaluation Structures (CAES2) in Higher-Ordered Logic (HOL) for the [Isabelle proof assistant](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/).  CAES2 is the formal model of structured arguments implemented in [Version 4 of the Carneades argumentation system](https://github.com/carneades/carneades-4). The goal of this formalization is to facilitate machine-checked proofs of theorems about CAES2 properties.
